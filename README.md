# Music Sales Analysis - 2019 - 2021

This repository contains an analysis of my music sales from 2019-2021.  The data was acquired through tunecore.com, my music distributor, as csv files.  

## Tools

I completed the analysis in R and summarized my findings in Rmarkdown.  

## Inspiration

This analysis was completed to determine where to focus ads over the next year by looking at the sales and number of streams from different locations.  Ever since streaming became popular, it has been much more difficult to make substantial money from music sales.  The goal of this analysis is to come up with a plan to increase sales based on data.
